## Score Summary

A criterion that does not apply cannot be failed, so **Met counts both `[x]` satisfied and `[~]`
justified N/A items**, over the full total of 49. This matches how other AOSSIE and Stability Nexus
projects score the same checklist, so the figures are comparable across repositories.

  - *Evidence URL:* [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/StabilityNexus/Fate-EVM-Frontend/issues) — public repository, full history readable without an account.

### Vulnerability Reporting

- [ ] 🔴 **vulnerability_report_process** — A vulnerability reporting process is documented (e.g., `SECURITY.md`).
  - *Note:* Unmet. No `SECURITY.md` exists in this repository, and none exists at the `StabilityNexus` organisation level either.

- [ ] 🟡 **vulnerability_report_private** — If private vulnerability reporting is supported, the method for private submission is documented.
  - *Note:* Unmet, and dependent on `vulnerability_report_process`. To be documented in `SECURITY.md`.

- [~] 🔴 **vulnerability_report_response** — Initial response to any vulnerability report received in the last 6 months was within 14 days.
  - *Justification:* N/A. No vulnerability reports have been received.

---

## ✅ Quality

### Build System

- [x] 🔴 **build** — A working build system exists that can auto-rebuild from source.
  - *Evidence URL:* `npm run build` in [package.json](package.json); the GitHub Pages workflow rebuilds from source on every merge to `main`.

- [x] 🔵 **build_common_tools** — Common build tools are used. *(SUGGESTED)*
  - *Evidence URL:* npm, with Next.js as the build tool. See [package.json](package.json).

- [x] 🟡 **build_floss_tools** — The project can be built using only FLOSS tools.
  - *Note:* Node.js, npm, Next.js, TypeScript and Tailwind are all open source. No proprietary tooling is required to build.

### Automated Testing

- [ ] 🔵 **test_invocation** — The test suite can be invoked in a standard way for the language. *(SUGGESTED)*
  - *Note:* Unmet. There is no test runner configured in this repository.

- [ ] 🔵 **test_most** — The test suite covers most code branches, input fields, and functionality. *(SUGGESTED)*
  - *Estimated coverage %:* 0. No automated test suite exists.

### New Functionality Testing Policy

- [ ] 🔴 **test_policy** — The project has a general policy that new functionality must include tests.
  - *Note:* Unmet. No such policy is stated, because no test suite exists to add tests to. Declaring the policy before the suite exists would be inaccurate.

- [ ] 🔴 **tests_are_added** — Evidence exists that the test policy has been followed in recent major changes.
  - *Note:* Unmet, dependent on `test_policy`.

- [ ] 🔵 **tests_documented_added** — The test policy is documented in contribution instructions. *(SUGGESTED)*
  - *Note:* Unmet, dependent on `test_policy`. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) currently documents the verification steps that do exist: lint, build, and manual browser testing.

### Linting / Warning Flags

- [x] 🔴 **warnings** — At least one linter or compiler warning flag is enabled.
  - *Tool used:* ESLint via `next lint`, configured in [eslint.config.mjs](eslint.config.mjs) with `eslint-config-next`. TypeScript type checking runs as part of `npm run build`.

- [ ] 🔴 **warnings_fixed** — Warnings from the linter are addressed (not suppressed without reason).
  - *Note:* Unmet. `npm run build` currently emits two ESLint warnings: a `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warning in `PoolConfigurationStep.tsx` and a `@next/next/no-img-element` warning in `TokenImage.tsx`. Both are understood and tracked.

- [ ] 🔵 **warnings_strict** — Project uses maximum strictness in linter config where practical. *(SUGGESTED)*
  - *Note:* Unmet. The project uses the `eslint-config-next` defaults rather than a hardened ruleset.

## 🔐 Security

### Secure Development Knowledge

- [x] 🔴 **know_secure_design** — At least one primary developer knows how to design secure software.
  - *Self-certification note:* Maintainers are familiar with secure-by-default design and threat modelling for Web3 frontends, including the risks of transaction construction, approval scope, and displaying untrusted on-chain data.

- [x] 🔴 **know_common_errors** — At least one primary developer knows common vulnerability types for this software's category.
  - *Self-certification note:* Maintainers are familiar with XSS, injection, and supply-chain risks in the frontend, and with reentrancy, oracle manipulation, and decimal or unit-scaling errors on the contract side that the UI must not misrepresent.

### Cryptography

*The six criteria below are marked N/A for a shared reason: this project performs no cryptographic
operations of its own. Transaction signing and key custody are delegated entirely to the user's
wallet, and hashing and ABI encoding are handled by the viem library. The project neither
implements, selects, nor stores cryptographic material.*

- [~] 🔴 **crypto_published** — Only publicly reviewed cryptographic protocols/algorithms are used by default.
  - *Justification:* N/A. See the shared note above. The underlying EVM primitives (ECDSA over secp256k1, keccak-256) are standard and are applied by the wallet and by viem, not by this project.

- [~] 🟡 **crypto_call** — Project calls an established crypto library rather than reimplementing crypto functions.
  - *Justification:* N/A by the shared note; where hashing or encoding is needed, viem is used. Nothing is reimplemented.

- [~] 🔴 **crypto_working** — No broken algorithms are used.
  - *Justification:* N/A. See the shared note above.

- [~] 🔴 **crypto_keylength** — Key lengths meet NIST 2030 minimums by default.
  - *Justification:* N/A. The project generates and stores no keys.

- [~] 🔴 **crypto_password_storage** — Passwords for external users are stored as iterated salted hashes.
  - *Justification:* N/A. There are no user accounts and no passwords. Authentication is wallet-based.

- [~] 🔴 **crypto_random** — Cryptographic keys and nonces are generated using a CSPRNG.
  - *Justification:* N/A. The project generates no cryptographic keys or nonces.

- [x] 🟡 **delivery_unsigned** — Cryptographic hashes are NOT retrieved over plain HTTP without a signature check.
  - *Note:* Dependencies are installed from the npm registry over HTTPS with integrity hashes pinned in `package-lock.json`. The application fetches no hashes over plain HTTP.

## 🔬 Analysis

### Static Code Analysis

- [x] 🔴 **static_analysis_fixed** — All medium+ severity vulnerabilities found by static analysis are fixed in a timely manner after confirmation.
  - *Note:* No medium or higher severity findings have been reported by static analysis to date. The two outstanding ESLint warnings are a hook-dependency and an image-element warning, neither of which is a security finding; they are tracked under `warnings_fixed`.

- [ ] 🔵 **static_analysis_common_vulnerabilities** — The static analysis tool includes checks for common vulnerabilities. *(SUGGESTED)*
  - *Note:* Unmet. The ESLint configuration does not currently include a security ruleset such as `eslint-plugin-security`.

- [ ] 🔵 **static_analysis_often** — Static analysis runs on every commit or at least daily. *(SUGGESTED)*
  - *Note:* Unmet. Pull requests to this repository currently trigger no CI checks; the only workflows are the Pages deployment on merge and a merge-conflict labeller.

### Dynamic Code Analysis

- [ ] 🔵 **dynamic_analysis** — At least one dynamic analysis tool is applied before major releases. *(SUGGESTED)*
  - *Note:* Unmet. No dynamic analysis tooling is configured.

- [ ] 🔵 **dynamic_analysis_enable_assertions** — Dynamic analysis / testing runs with assertions enabled. *(SUGGESTED)*
  - *Note:* Unmet, dependent on there being an automated test suite.

- [~] 🔴 **dynamic_analysis_fixed** — Medium+ severity vulnerabilities found by dynamic analysis are fixed in a timely manner.
  - *Justification:* N/A. No dynamic analysis has been run, so there are no findings to act on. This becomes applicable once `dynamic_analysis` is met.

- [~] 🔵 **dynamic_analysis_unsafe** — If the project uses memory-unsafe languages, memory safety tools are used. *(SUGGESTED)*
  - *Justification:* N/A. The project is written in TypeScript, a memory-safe language, and ships no native code.

## 📎 Project-Specific Notes

**Full-Stack / Next.js.** The application is a static export (`output: "export"`), so it has no
server runtime, no API routes, and no server-side session or credential handling. This removes a
large class of criteria from scope, which is why the Cryptography section is entirely N/A.

**Web3.** Contract-level security belongs to `StabilityNexus/Fate-Solidity`, which is assessed
separately. This frontend must not misrepresent on-chain state; the most security-relevant class of
bug here is unit confusion, since three distinct numeric scales are in play (base-token decimals read
on-chain, WAD 1e18 for oracle values, and `DENOMINATOR = 100000` for contract fees). This is
documented for contributors in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
